# React-Weather-App


## Description
This React application gives weather data based on a city name. A user can type a city name into the search bar and information about that city will appear. This includes local time, a description of the weather, the temperature, humidity, wind speed, the time of sunrise and sunset, the highest and lowest temperature for the day, and also an hourly and daily forecast.

If the user allows this application to access their geolocation, the weather for where the user is located can automatically be fetched.
