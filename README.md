# React-Weather-App


## Description
This React application gives weather data based on a city name. A user can type a city name into the search bar and information about that city will appear. This includes local time, a description of the weather, the temperature, humidity, wind speed, the time of sunrise and sunset, the highest and lowest temperature for the day, and also an hourly and daily forecast.

If the user allows this application to access their geolocation, the weather for the user's current location can automatically be fetched.

The background of the application changes colour to reflect the city's temperature. Different shades of orange and red appear for hot cities, different shades of blue appear for colder cities.
